### Tasks

- **Custom Task Creation**: Tailor your workspace to fit your needs by creating and organizing tasks essential to your projects. Our intuitive task management system allows you to categorize tasks, set priorities, and track progress, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.

### Analytics

- **In-Depth Task Time Progress**: Gain valuable insights into how your time is allocated across different tasks and projects. Our analytics feature visualizes your task time progress in an easily digestible format, choosing between line graphs or histograms based on what best suits your needs. By analyzing your work patterns, you can identify areas for improvement and optimize your productivity.
